# EL03

## Learning Outcomes

- Practice with for loops
- Practice with for lists

## Tasks

This lab is rather free-form. Tasks are not marked out like before. 

You have five function headers, each of which performs some basic statistical tasks on the given list of numbers.

The `main` contains one `expect` test for each of them. Implement each function and add at least two more test cases for each. The functions descriptions are self-explanatory.

Make sure you submit the lab by clicking the submit button or by pushing to git externally before the deadline.
