# EL04

## Learning Outcomes

- Practice with recursion

## Tasks

In this lab, you will implement two independent functions on lists. Your solutions must use recursion to get full marks. Implement `is_non_decreasing` and `is_palindrome` to match their descriptions.

The `main` contains some `expect` test for each of them. Add at least two more test cases for each.

Make sure you submit the lab by clicking the submit button or by pushing to git externally before the deadline.
