## Task 1

- Got an output of `All tests passed.`
- Compiler throws a `std::logic_error` runtime error as `cp::check` fails.

## Task 2

- It won't run successfully
- Yes I understood the function `equal_enough`
- Got the expected output replacing == operator with equal_enough function

## Task 3

#### Data
double 

#### Contract and header 
```cpp 
    double area_square( double side) 
```
Calculates the area of the square given its positive side value. Side should be positive value as area doesn't make sense for negative values.

#### Examples
4 area_square(2)
6.25 area_square(2.5)
