# A4

## Learning Outcomes

- Processing file input
- Handling reasonably complex data

## Tasks

This assignment is fairly open-ended, as in, we are giving very little boiler-plate code, leaving it up to you to desing the appropriate functions and structures.

Read the given function headers and comments carefully. Design the `struct scorecard` so it captures what you need. Implement the functions `read_scorecard` and `report` to match their descriptions. Add as many helper functions as you want to complete the task. You must add at least two meaningful functions to get full marks.

### Example

The given `main` processes the given `team1.txt` and `team2.txt` and produces the output:

```sh
Team-2 (38) beats Team-1 (30)
The highest scorer(s): Sunil (20)
```

### Functions to read data from a file

Look at these functions on the `input_file` class in our [library](https://swaroopjoshi.in/courses/cp-library/classcp_1_1input__file.html):

- `read_int`
- `read_char`
- `read_bool`
- `read_double`
- `read<cp::string>`

You can use them in any program for taking input from a file.

## Important

No late submission is allowed for this assignment. The *hard* deadline is Thu. 16 Jun, 2022, 11:59 pm.
